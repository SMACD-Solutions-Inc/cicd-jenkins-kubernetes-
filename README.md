# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins & Kubernetes

## 📋 Project Overview

Designed and implemented an end-to-end automated CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based application using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and integrated security/quality gates. This pipeline automated the entire software delivery process from code commit to production deployment.

## 🎯 Business Challenge

**Client:** Mid-sized SaaS company (Series A, 80+ employees)

**Problems:**
- Manual deployment process taking 4-6 hours per release
- Inconsistent builds across environments
- No automated testing or security scanning
- High error rate during deployments (~15% rollback rate)
- Developers waiting days for code to reach production
- No visibility into deployment status

**Impact:**
- Slow time-to-market for new features
- Developer frustration and bottlenecks
- Production incidents due to untested code
- High operational costs
